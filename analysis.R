### SUMMARY ###
# The disease likely began in Country X. This is because the cases started much earlier in Country X than they
# did in Country Y (as seen in the two graphs "Country X Infected Cases" and "Country Y Infected Cases"). From that, it can
# be logically concluded that the disease first appeared in Country X and then evolved as it traveled to Country Y, where
# cases began to appear after first being detected in Country X.

# A vaccine developed for Country Y is likely not to work for Country X. Differences in which markers are present
# in a screening indicate differences in the protein of the disease and possibly a difference in a patient's response to
# the bacteria within their immune system. This means that, if the people of Country Y and Country X have largely
# different markers appearing in their screenings, a vaccine meant to target a specific variant of the bacteria in one
# country would likely be ineffective in the other. This is the case for these countries, as Country X has a prevalence
# of markers 1-5 while Country Y has a prevalence of markers 6-10 with some 4 and 5 (as seen in the graphs "Marker Count of
# Country X" and "Marker Count of Country Y"). Therefore, the disease has evolved enough while traveling between
# countries that a vaccine from Country Y would probably see resistance from the disease in Country X and be ineffective on
# the country's citizens.
